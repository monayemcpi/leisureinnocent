== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What’s the difference between Product Sales Report and Export Order Items? =

Product Sales Report is for creating a report about all your products or a group of products for comparison and sales performance. [Export Order Items](https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-order-items-for-woocommerce/) generates a report with the items from an individual order, specific purchase, or specific customer for order fulfillment or accounting.

= What’s the difference between the free and pro version? =

The free version is powerful and works well for 90% of store owners. If you need additional control the [pro version](https://aspengrovestudios.com/product/product-sales-report-pro-for-woocommerce/) includes the ability to report on product variations individually, report on products with no sales, report on shipping methods used, export in Excel formats, send the report as an attachment, save an unlimited number of presets, change the names of fields in the report, change the order of the fields/columns, limit the report to orders with a matching custom meta field (e.g. delivery date), and include any custom field defined by WooCommerce or another plugin and associated with a product (note: custom fields associated with individual product variations are not supported at this time).
